My way of following the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Geron Aurelien. Trying to understand better ML. <br><br>

Chapter 2. - Regression on data set "California Housing Prices". <br>
Chapter 3. - Classification on data set "MNIST". <br>
Chapter 4. - Linear, Polynomial, Logistic Regression + Gradient Descent, Learning Curves, Regularized Linear Models. <br>
Chapter 5. - SVM <br>
