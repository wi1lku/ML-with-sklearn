# ML-with-sklearn
My way of following the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Geron Aurelien. Trying to understand better ML. <br><br>

Chapter 1. - First model - introduction. <br>
Chapter 2. - Regression on data set "California Housing Prices". <br>
Chapter 3. - Classification on data set "MNIST". <br>
Chapter 4. - Linear, Polynomial, Logistic Regression + Gradient Descent, Learning Curves, Regularized Linear Models. <br>
Chapter 5. - SVM. <br>
Chapter 6. - Decision Trees. <br>
Chapter 7. - Ensemble Learning and Random Forests. <br>
Chapter 8. - Dimensionality Reduction. <br>
Chapter 9. - Unsupervised Learning Techniques. Clustering and Gaussian Mixtures.
